__I don't care.__ I really don't. Do whatever the hell you want with it.

## TODO

 - Write a proper README ... this ain't acceptable for humans.
 - Push the rest of the provisioning scripts up (only Ruby for now because the provisioning for it works well ... the other scripts have some issues I must fix first).
